Ali Sadiq MS2 – Pharm Online

[View the live project here.](https://alisadiq91.github.io/PharmOnline/index.html)

This is the second project of my software development career. I have decided to create a website for a chain of pharmacies that have decided to delve into the world of online pharmacy. The company name has changed to PharmOnline because of this. I will be using what I have learnt from my recent modules covering Javascript and Jquery, as well as how to include an API in a website. I will also use HTML, CSS and the bootstrap framework. I am attempting to show a vast range of what I have learnt, including emailJS, incorporating APIs and using Javascript to monitor how a user interacts with the website. 
The website is for the company Pharm Online. They are an online Pharmacy which also have 4 stores across the UK.  They currently have a site in Leeds, Bradford, York and Manchester, which each offer a range of services. They also have a mobile app which is used for online ordering of medication. 

--- UX --- USER STORIES ---

• First Time Visitor Goals

1.	As a First Time Visitor, I want to know exactly what services I am able to access.

2.	As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.

3.	As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to know exactly how I can contact the pharmacies, be it online or at their stores. 

4.	As a First Time Visitor, I want to know where each pharmacy is based to see if there is one close to where I live.

5.  As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to choose a service and make an appointment at my chosen branch.

• Returning Visitor Goals

1.	As a Returning Visitor, I want to know how to download the application to order my medication. 

2.	As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to know exactly what the steps are of how to use an online pharmacy.

3.	As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to have any questions I have answered before I commit to anything. 

• Frequent User Goals

1.	As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new services available at each store.

2.  As a Frequent User, I want to be able to book other services at the same branch. 

Being a registered UK pharmacist myself, I have visited many pharmacy websites and apps, and of course worked in many branches.
With me being vastly experienced in this sector, I know exactly what the consumer wants, making it easy for me to provide this in a simple way.

--- DESIGN ---

Colour Scheme

•	The two main colours used are white smoke and navy.

Typography

•	The Roboto Condensed font is the font used for the logo. The Raleway font is the main font used for all other content. Sans Serif is used as the fallback font if for any reason the above fonts are not functioning. A professional theme is set which these two fonts help achieve. They are also both clear and easy to read.

--- WIREFRAMES AND FEATURES ---

Header – languages used – HTML, CSS, Font Awesome https://fontawesome.com/, Bootstrap

Features:

1.	The logo – this is of course in the header, so it is on every page. It is at the top on desktop devices but just below the menu on smaller devices.  

2.	Side Menu – I created a pop-out side menu to give interactivity to the site and to help the design on mobile devices as the nav links would take up a large space of the page if the side menu was not created.

3.	In mobile view, the "Menu" is above the logo so the user can easily scroll to the top and find it there.

4.  Each nav link has an icon from font awesome and changes colour when hovering.

5.  The side menu background colour is slightly darker than the background of the website so that it stands out once opened. 


Features to implement :

1.	I wanted to add a register link in my header, and to link this to a register page. This page would allow the user the option to use our facilities on the website too as opposed to just the app. This is something that I will be able to do later in my developing career. 

![header-desktop](https://github.com/alisadiq91/PharmOnline/blob/master/assets/images/header-desktop.png)

![sidemenu-desktop](https://github.com/alisadiq91/PharmOnline/blob/master/assets/images/sidemenu-desktop.png)

Footer – languages used – HTML, CSS, fontawesome (https://fontawesome.com/)

Features:

1.	Contact us – here is a link with a hover effect to the contact us page. As well as opening times and a phone number for general enquiries. This number has a link to the user’s phone app. 

2.	Download the app – in the middle is a link to the apple store and the google play store for users to download the companies app. 

3.	Follow – each page must contain links to the business’s social platforms, with a hover effect too.

![footer-desktop](https://github.com/alisadiq91/PharmOnline/blob/master/assets/images/footer-desktop.png)

Home page – 

Languages used – HTML, CSS, Javascript using JQuery, font awesome https://fontawesome.com/), Bootstrap

Home page wireframe (desktop)

Home page wireframe (mobile)

![home-mobile-wireframe](https://github.com/alisadiq91/PharmOnline/blob/master/assets/images/home-mobile-wireframe.jpg)

Features

1.	Main image – An eye-catching picture, showing a happy patient receiving their medication. Also, with pharmacists behind with happy expressions. I want to show the consumer a satisfied customer.

2.	Providing services image – Here is an image showing the pharmacy provides services by the NHS, this is a widely used logo. 

3.	Main list – I want the customer to know exactly what is available to them. Here is a list of points of what they can expect to experience, re-iterating the word “free” where possible. Underneath this are again, links to the google play store and apple store to download the app. 

![main-page-desktop](https://github.com/alisadiq91/PharmOnline/blob/master/assets/images/main-page-desktop.png)

4.	Steps of how it works – Originally I planned to have these steps as all showing and the user to hover to reveal more information. I decided to change this and add bootstrap carousel to improve the interactivity for the user. This gives the website a cleaner and simpler look. There are 4 steps, each shown as an image with a caption. When this is hovered over (clicked on mobile/tablet), a more detailed description of this step is revealed to the user. This was done using Javascript with JQuery.

![steps-desktop](https://github.com/alisadiq91/PharmOnline/blob/master/assets/images/steps-desktop.png)

![steps-hover](https://github.com/alisadiq91/PharmOnline/blob/master/assets/images/steps-hover.png)

Features to implement:

1.	I had the idea to add a large image under the steps, for the user to click to download the app, but I decided against it as I wanted to keep the website simple. 

2.	When there are new services to advertise, this can be under the header to show frequent users.

![findus-mobile](https://github.com/alisadiq91/PharmOnline/blob/master/assets/images/find-us-mobile.jpg)

Features

1.	Page title – A simple “where to find us?” to catch the eye of the user. 

2.	Map – I used the google map API to incorporate a map and the location of the stores. This gives the user the chance to zoom in on each location and find out exactly where they are. Each location has been given a custom marker, an image universally used as health or pharmacy. When the user clicks the marker, a window pops up with the name of the pharmacy. 

3.	When the user clicks a marker, the branch details pop up below with a form for the user to fill out related to what service they require.

4. Above the form, the user is told what branch they have selected, to make sure they are happy with their choice.

![map-popup-window](https://github.com/alisadiq91/PharmOnline/blob/master/assets/images/map-popup.png)

5. The user now chooses which service they require from the drop down list. If a service is chosen, another input field appears asking the customer what date they would like to book their appointment.

![form-date](https://github.com/alisadiq91/PharmOnline/blob/master/assets/images/form-date.png)

6. If the user chooses the option "Other", instead of an input field for the date, an text box appears for the user to type what service they require from the chosen branch.

![form-other](https://github.com/alisadiq91/PharmOnline/blob/master/assets/images/form-other.png)

7. When the form is submitted, an alert box appears telling the customer that the branch will be in touch with them regarding their appointment.

![map-form-alert](https://github.com/alisadiq91/PharmOnline/blob/master/assets/images/form-map-alert.png)

8. The submit button is “btn-primary” (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/) button from bootstrap as the colour matches the theme used in the website.

9. Using EmailJS, the business is now sent this request by email in the format shown below. If the user selects the Other option, the text they type in is shown under additional info.

![map-emailjs](https://github.com/alisadiq91/PharmOnline/blob/master/assets/images/map-emailjs.png)

-------------   10. Each field is set to required and the email must be submitted in the correct format. ------------------

11. The EmailJS is set to send a copy of the email to the user for test purposes.

12. The page is set to respond to smaller devices by having the branch address on top of the form instead of side by side.

![map-form-mobile](https://github.com/alisadiq91/PharmOnline/blob/master/assets/images/map-form-mobile.png)


Covid19 page – languages used – HTML, CSS, font awesome

Features

2.	This is a very simple page, with Covid-19 being a huge part of peoples lives at present, it is expected that a website providing healthcare to include some advice on how to stay safe. The page includes the 3 ways to stay safe advised by the UK government, with a video embedded to go along with each piece of advice. I have also added a font awesome logo to each point.

FAQ page wireframe (mobile)

![faq-mobile-wireframe](https://github.com/alisadiq91/PharmOnline/blob/master/assets/images/faq-mobile-wireframe.jpg)

Features

1.	This page contains 5 frequently asked questions that many users would want answering before they use the service.

![faq-desktop](https://github.com/alisadiq91/PharmOnline/blob/master/assets/images/faq-desktop.png)

2.This has been executed using Javascript with JQuery. When the user clicks each question, a toggle effect is used. The answer to the question is now shown underneath. It is given a speed of “500” to give a smooth effect.

![faq-answers](https://github.com/alisadiq91/PharmOnline/blob/master/assets/images/faq-answers.png)

3.The colour of the answer is different to that of the question to help it stand out to the user. 

4.Once the user clicks the question, the answer stays open until they click the question again as it is a toggle effect. This allows the user to see the answer to more than one question at the same time.

Features

1.	This page contains a simple form that allows the user to send a message to the company. It only asks for their name and email address, and the message they would like to pass on.

![contactus-desktop](https://github.com/alisadiq91/PharmOnline/blob/master/assets/images/contactus-desktop.png)

2.	Each field is set to required, and the email field will only accept email formats. 

![contactus-required](https://github.com/alisadiq91/PharmOnline/blob/master/assets/images/contactus-req.png)

![contactus-required-email](https://github.com/alisadiq91/PharmOnline/blob/master/assets/images/contactus-emailreq.png)

3.	The message box is larger than the other input fields to give the user more space to write a detailed message.

4.	The submit button is “btn-primary” (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/) button from bootstrap as the colour matches the theme used in the website. 

5.	Once the submit button is pressed, the user will receive an alert thanking them for submitting a message and that usually the company replies within 2 working days.

![form-alert](https://github.com/alisadiq91/PharmOnline/blob/master/assets/images/form-alert.png)

6.	Once submitted, the fields automatically reset. 

7.	I used Javascript to use emailJs so that any questions or messages submitted can be seen by the company on their email address. This is currently set up to my email address. I have also set the email template to send a copy of the email to the sender so anyone using the form can be sure it has sent. The message is shown in the format below:

Deployment

I used GitPod to write my code.

I regularly used Git Push to deploy this page to GitHub. Whenever I completed a page, fixed an error, or finished coding for the day, I would git commit and then git push.

I used the information in this webpage to create my GitHub pages site. https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site

The link above gave me the following steps.

1.	Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.

2.	At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.

3.	Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.

4.	Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".

5.	The page will automatically refresh.

6.	Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site link in the "GitHub Pages" section.
